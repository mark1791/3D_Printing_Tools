# FreeCAD 3D Printing Tools
A FreeCAD Workbench for working on imported Meshes.  

# Description
This workbench has a number of features to help working with imported `.stl` models.  
Utilizing the functionality available within the FreeCAD Mesh Design workbench this workbench helps the user to scale and modify meshes.

## Features

* The ability to convert imperial mesh(es) to Metric and vice-versa.  
* Scale a mesh up/down 50%.  
* Scale mesh a set factor.  
* Scale Mesh to fit a 3D printer bed size.  
* Generate an STL box by the size of the printer bed for reference.  
* Convert mesh(es) to solid(s).  
* Make a transparent object.  
* Make an object's transparency Solid.  
* Show/Hide an object.

* Change the color of a group of objects to a random colour.  
* Change the line width to 2.0  
* Show the bounding box of an STL mesh.  
* Define the printer bed size.  
* Define the size of the object to be scaled from.  
* Define the Scale factor for the mesh to be scaled, ex. 0.5 = 50% scale; 2.0 = 200% scale.
